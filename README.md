# Custom-Page-Content
You will find in the email example a CloudPageURL that you use to direct the user to a landing page. You utilize the CloudPages ID and subscriberkey information to pass along a encrypted link.

Next on the Landing Page example this provides example of customizable AMPscript code to get the information from the URL, and check it against a data extension. Then display content based on the users data in the extension. 

You can add as many variable content as you want as long as you remember to 
1. Define the Variable
2. Set the variable
3. Declare it with a IF ELSE in the Landing Page. 


Have fun, do good, enjoy!
